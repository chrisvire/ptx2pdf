\is1 Introduction
\ip This is a demonstration of polyglot setting. The intention is to stretch the code 
and show what it can and can't do in different configurations: very different numbers of 
characters per verse, different fonts, footnotes, etc.
It's rather a challenging demonstration because the right-hand text (An annotated
version of the Wycliffe Bible) has a number in-text annotations, the left-had text has 
footnotes and cross-references. The centre text is of course in greek.

\ip The text is has been set twice, the first time, this is done respecting the
paragraphing of the WEB. (i.e.  a paragraph from the WEB should start at the
same vertical position as the Wycliffe text).
In this version, the footnotes are restricted to their respective columns.

\ip The text is then set with one-verse per paragraph.  This may look better in
the sense that the gaps on the page are smaller, but it is removing the
vaulable insights provided by paragraphing. 
In this version, as there are no footnotes in this Wycliffe text, the option
was chosen to not separate them.  Had there been footnotes in more than one of
the texts, they would have been (unpredictably?) mingled.

\h The history of diglot

\p
\v 1 This is the begining of the story of diglot.
\v 2 First Knuth made \TeX, then Kew made \XeTeX\ from \TeX.
\v 3 \XeTeX\ had a child called paratext2, and paratext2 had
a child called ptxplus.

\v 4 David took ptxplus and tweaked it in various places and so diglot came into being, and it lived in dark obscurity for many years, sometimes crafting text, sometimes creating strange things.

\p
\v 4 And David took ptxplus and did bend it in diverse places to make diglot.  Diglot dwelt in darkness and created beauty or disaster depending upon many factors.
\p

\p 
\v 5 Then Mark and Martin created  of a beautiful thing called ptxprint  using Something Completely Different called python, and asked David to possibly make the diglot code fit into it.
 And David had time, and patched some bugs in diglot and also in ptxprint. And so it was that diglot ventured out into the world.

\p 
\v 5 And then did Mark and Martin come together and used Something Completely Different,  named python, and crafted the wondrous ptxprint. And David was asked if diglot would wed ptxprint. And David found the precious  treasure called time, and trimmed some strangenesses from diglot, and even from ptxprint  also. And behold, the two became one and marched forth into the world.

\v 6 After meeting a lot of bugs that were seemed increasingly complex to track
down and fix, David (encouraged by Martin) delved deep into the insides of
diglot and re-wrote the 'text collection' part significantly.  
\v 7 Then, meeting
yet more bugs, he went on to rip out the old horrendously complex
column-filling/refilling/side swapping and layout portions of diglot.
\v 8 Triglot (or more) is not yet possible, but it's now almost within touching
distance.

\p
\v 6 Devious and pernicious were the bugs that
ailed diglot and David did valiantly battle
them, but it became apparent in the end
surgery more drastic was demanded.
\p
\v 7 And by the hefty sword known as \it rewrite\it*, David
conquered some of the bugs, and then he swung again at the innards of diglot
and diglot2 was born from the mess.
\p
\v 8 And with the coming of diglot2 there is the beacon of hope, for diglot2 is written such that triglots and polyglots may come to pass.

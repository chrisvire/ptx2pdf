\s1 About this document
\p This document exists to show the reader what ornaments exist in the libraries. It does \bd not\bd* 
indicate that any of them are suitable for a specific audience.  For this
document, ornaments are shown preceded by their number, surrounded by a pale
blue box, and with a short horizontal line marking the baseline. The box
represents how big TeX has been told they are. It is known that there are some
boxing errors. The worst of these have been corrected, but a mechanism exists
(e.g. \"\OrnamentTweakX{pgfhan}{77}{-15.5}" to refine others).

\s Page catalogue.
\p This 'page' and those that follow is a catalogue of some
pre-defined borders.  They are displayed here as 'covers' - filling the whole 
of a 'page'. Note that some of the borders will include, exclude or
scale certain elements based on the actual size to which they are to
fill / surround, to minimise the required stretch/shrink. Thus there
may be unexpected changes from adjustments of the padding
etc.  
\p For all designs in real situations, some tweaking of the BoxPadding and
BorderPadding parameters may be very appropriate.
\E
\demoborder Vectorian1|a4 
\b
\p Vectorian1 uses the very ornate and quite floral ornament71, 
probably to excess. Notice how on with the default settings on A4 paper, one less ornament 72 is being used than when the same border was used on A5.
\p Borders where the coloured rectangle is inside the ornamental border have
zero or positive border padding. For a border fully inside the coloured
area, the border padding must equal (or be more negative than) -BorderWidth

\E
\demoborder Vectorian2|a5 
\b
\p Vectorian2 is still uses the quite 'leafy' ornament 70, but does
not have the overly detailed element 71 that Vectorian 1 does.\E
\demoborder Vectorian3|a5 
\b
\p Vectorian3 also uses ornament70, but uses different corner and
edge-fill parts.\E
\demoborder Vectorian4|a5 
\b
\p Vectorian4 uses spacing as fill, without ornament 70.\E

\p Notice the border here is outside the colour-fill area.
That's what the 'out' in the naming scheme means.

\s Scaling issues
\pc
This border is made from a pair ornaments intended to align perfectly.
Nevertheless, with the corners needing to be significantly larger than
the edges, this was very difficult to achieve just using a scaling number.  The \" \bksl OrnamentScaleRef "  line in the
\"standardborders.sty" file provides a perfectly matching scaling of
different elements, but the final result still isn't perfect without
some further manual adjustment using the 'alignment tweak' parameter.
This is because the size of the ornament is always an
integer number of the natural units, but the vectors themselves 
are at fractional heights.

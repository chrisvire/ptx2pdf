\s1 Helps for the reader
\m Keep these matters in mind while reading:
\li 1. Wherever there is a word or phrase \w marked like this\w* it shows that this is a new or difficult word (for example, baptism, synagogue, or Pharisee). Words like these have an explanation in the glossary section at the end of the book.
\li 2. In order to understand more about a word or phrase which is marked with a symbol like this* you need to read about it at the bottom of the page. 
\li 3. And a symbol like this† indicated that this matter also is contained in another book - look for the reference at the bottom of the page.
\li 4. In some places, in the original language books, where these words are not there, and in some books where verses have been missed, in order to show them, *[we have marked in square brackets like this] and have explained about them at the bottom of the page.

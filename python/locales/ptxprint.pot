"The anchor specifies what page in a book a picture will appear on. It "
"appears on the same page as its anchor in the text. You can alter the Anchor "
"Ref by a few verses to change the page on which it appears.\n"
"\n"
"An Anchor Ref must consist of a book code, perhaps followed by L or R (in "
"the case of a diglot), then a space, then an in-book location which contains "
"a dot (period). In a scripture book, the in-book location is Chap.Verse "
"where the Verse matches the \\v value precisely. In other books, the in-book "
"location can be anything as long as it is unique in that book and contains a "
"dot (period).\n"
"\n"
"Anchor Refs for Diglots use the L or R suffix on the 3-letter book code to "

"\n"
"In the glossary book (GLO) there is special support for \\k Keywords\\k* "

"Keyword or phrase\\k* with its spaces removed. For example,\n"
"\n"
"    GLO k.Altar - would link it to \\k Altar\\k*\n"
"    GLO k.JohntheBaptist - would link a picture to\n"

"You can copy-and-paste a glossary word or phrase after typing GLO k. and "

"\n"
"Where there are no intervening anchors, you can anchor to the Nth paragraph "
"of e.g. poetry or a keyterm definition, by specifying the paragraph number "
"after an = sign. For example, GLO k.Harp=2 or PSA 23.4=3. This can avoid the "

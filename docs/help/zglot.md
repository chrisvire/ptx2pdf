# zglot
## Summary
Select fonts, etc. for a serial diglot.
## Examples
```
\doublecolumns
\zglot|L\*
\s Introduction to the New Testament
\zgetperiph|side="L" id="intnt"\*

```
## Description

`zglot` carries out all the font-switching needed to correctly display content from a diglot file, but in a monoglot format.
This is probably the right thing to do for book introductions, etc. where there
is no guarantee that there is any correspondence between what contents the two
languages have.

# zbl
## Summary
Pseudo-milestone to insert multiple blank lines

## Examples

\zbl|3\*
```
## Description
The example is the equivalent of `\b\b\b`. Change the number for different gaps. 
This is not *actually* a milestone, in that it is processed by the Python pre-processor, and cannot be used in triggers, etc.
Normal argument processing is not possible.

## Summary
Character style for margin verse markers.
## Description
Sometimes, when using marginal verses, it is still desired to mark the verse transition.
Normally not used explicitly, this character style is applied automatically to apply styling for the 
(optional) in-text mark left at the point of the verse-change.
